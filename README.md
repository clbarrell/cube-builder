## Key Components

- **FirstPersonControls**: Handles camera movement and player input
- **Floor**: Renders the ground plane and grid
- **Lighting**: Sets up scene lighting
- **BasicShapes**: Renders basic 3D shapes for reference
- **Cube**: A sample game entity with animation

## Game Systems

- **CollisionSystem**: Handles collision detection and resolution
- **GameState**: Manages game state using Zustand

## Development

1. Install dependencies:

   ```
   pnpm install
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`:

   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. Start the development server and Socket.io server together:

   ```
   pnpm dev:all
   ```

   Or run them separately:

   ```
   # Terminal 1 - Client
   pnpm dev

   # Terminal 2 - Server
   pnpm server
   ```

4. Build for production:

   ```
   pnpm build
   pnpm build:server
   ```

5. Start the production server:
   ```
   pnpm start
   ```

TODO
- Something that let's me enter some commands to control the server. like "reset clock" and stuff.
